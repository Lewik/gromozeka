# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform Project (MPP) with the following modules:
- `bot` - The main application module containing the gromozeka bot application
- `shared` - A library module with shared code and models
- `docs/` - Project documentation including architectural decisions and philosophy

## Build and Test Commands

- Build project: `./gradlew build`
- Run application: `./gradlew :bot:run`
- Run all tests: `./gradlew :bot:jvmTest` (JVM tests) or `./gradlew :bot:allTests` (all platforms)
- Clean build: `./gradlew clean`
- Compile: `./gradlew compileKotlin`

**IMPORTANT**: Always run tests after making changes: `./gradlew :bot:allTests -q` (quiet mode for KMP)


## Project Overview

**Concept**: Gromozeka - multi-armed AI agent (named after the character from "The Mystery of the Third Planet"). This is not just another chatbot, but a "handy" agent with multiple capabilities for interacting with system, services, and various APIs.

**Core Philosophy**: Maximum practical utility through integration with real tools. The agent should not only talk but also perform tasks - work with files, send requests, manage system, integrate with external services.

**Architecture Stack**:
- **UI**: JetBrains Compose Desktop
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code CLI wrapper + Spring AI
- **Core Features**: Text chat, voice input (STT), tool calling, MCP support, session management
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new "arms" (capabilities)

**Key Differentiators**:
- Claude Code CLI integration for rich tool ecosystem
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for modular capability extension
- Real-time streaming responses
- Persistent sessions with context
- Desktop-first approach for maximum development convenience

**Naming**: "Gromozeka" - internal codename, may be changed for release

## Claude Code Integration Plan

**Research results**: Claude Code provides rich out-of-the-box ecosystem (tools, sub-agents, MCP servers, IDE integration) that would be expensive to replicate. While alternatives like DeepSeek V3 are cheaper per token, Claude Code's developer experience and built-in capabilities justify the cost for this use case.

**Hybrid approach**:
- **Claude Code CLI wrapper**: For core AI chat functionality, tool calling, MCP integration
- **Spring AI**: Keep for STT/TTS services and existing voice features
- **Integration method**: Command line SDK via ProcessBuilder with JSON output parsing

**Key integration points**:
- `claude -p "prompt" --output-format json` for structured responses
- `--mcp-config` for MCP server configuration
- `--allowedTools` for tool access control
- Session management via `--resume` and `--continue`

See docs/ folder for Claude Code integration documentation.

## Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Core Concept

Gromozeka is a multi-armed AI agent designed as a **desktop-first application** for individual developers. Unlike traditional chatbots, Gromozeka emphasizes **practical utility through real tool integration**.

**Scope**: Personal development tool with desktop-first architecture. Current implementation optimized for single-user, local environment. Future: thin client architecture with "brain" running on capable hardware (desktop/server) and UI clients (mobile/lightweight desktop) connecting remotely.

### Architectural Principles

#### 1. Single Source of Truth: File-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Parse only session files, not streaming output.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability first**: Claude Code writes to disk immediately (no buffering) to prevent data loss on crash/Ctrl+C
- **Single parser**: Easier to maintain than dual parser system (streaming vs file)
- **Complete data**: Files contain full metadata that streaming may omit
- **Audit trail**: All interactions automatically persisted for debugging
- **Consistency**: Same parsing logic for both historical and new messages

**Performance analysis**:
- Session size limited by Claude's context window (auto-compaction)
- Typical file read time ‚âà 1ms on SSD for context-sized files
- FileWatcher delay = 200ms (protection against partial writes)
- **Total latency acceptable** for human interaction speeds

**Memory management**:
- No unbounded growth: Claude's auto-compaction limits session size
- Context boundaries provide natural memory limits
- Desktop scope: even worst-case memory usage is manageable

**Trade-offs accepted**:
- Minimal latency vs streaming (but human-imperceptible)
- FileWatcher complexity (but robust error handling added)
- Must handle partial file writes (delay + retry logic)

#### 2. Backend-Driven State Management

**Decision**: Kotlin backend manages all state, UI is purely reactive.

**Rationale**:
- Centralized state management via `Session` class (refactored from coordinator anti-pattern)
- Kotlin Flow for reactive updates (StateFlow/SharedFlow)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test business logic

**Current implementation**: `Session.kt` encapsulates all session logic - process management, file watching, state updates, and lifecycle.

#### 3. Claude Code Engine Focus

**Decision**: Architecture optimized specifically for Claude Code engine integration.

**Rationale**:
- Claude Code has unique session file format (.jsonl) and CLI behavior
- Claude Code's immediate file writes enable our FileWatcher approach
- Claude Code's auto-compaction provides natural session boundaries
- Other LLM engines would require completely different integration strategies
- Better to build one engine integration excellently than many poorly
- Future LLM engines = separate wrappers with engine-specific architectures

**Engine-specific design decisions**:
- Session ID extraction from Claude's `init` messages
- FileWatcher monitoring of `~/.claude/projects/` directory structure
- Parsing Claude's specific JSONL message format
- Resume behavior handling (new file creation)

### Technical Decisions

#### File Monitoring Strategy

```
Claude Process ‚Üí Writes JSONL ‚Üí FileWatcher detects ‚Üí Parser reads ‚Üí UI updates
```

**Why not streaming?**
- **Dual parser complexity**: Stream and file formats typically differ, requiring separate parsers
- **Processing inconsistency**: Historical messages often parsed differently than real-time ones
- **Maintenance overhead**: Multiple parsing paths increase complexity
- **Persistence guarantee**: Files are the only reliable storage that survives crashes
- **Simpler architecture**: Single parsing path reduces edge cases

#### Claude Code Session Management

**Engine-specific behavior**:
1. **New Session**: Start Claude CLI ‚Üí Extract session ID from `init` message ‚Üí Monitor new .jsonl file
2. **Resume Session**: Claude CLI creates new file (not reuse old) ‚Üí Update FileWatcher to new file via callback
3. **Session ID Mismatch Fix**: Always set up `onSessionIdCaptured` to handle Claude's file creation behavior

**Key insight**: Claude Code CLI always creates new files on resume, never appends to existing ones.

#### Error Handling

- Graceful FileWatcher recovery on crash
- Null-safety throughout Kotlin code
- Partial JSON line protection in parser

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Prefer file-based truth** over in-memory state
2. **Handle edge cases** (partial writes, crashes, race conditions)  
3. **Embrace Claude Code engine specifics** - leverage its unique behavior and .jsonl format
4. **Test with real Claude-generated session files** not mocked data
5. **Document engine-specific behaviors** and non-obvious decisions in code

### Validation Strategy

**"Validate in practice, not in CI":**
- FileWatcher behavior varies by platform - manual validation more reliable than flaky automated tests
- External process timing cannot be reliably tested in unit tests
- Focus automated testing on pure functions (parsers, data transformations)
- System integration behavior validated through real usage

### Future Considerations

#### Phase 1: Desktop Maturity
- **Performance**: Incremental file reading for very large sessions
- **Multi-session**: Better support for concurrent sessions  
- **Plugin system**: For adding new "arms" (capabilities)

#### Phase 2: Client-Server Architecture
- **Remote UI clients**: Mobile apps, lightweight desktop clients
- **Network protocol**: Stream session updates to remote clients (WebSocket/gRPC)
- **"Brain" separation**: Core logic + Claude Code engine integration runs on powerful hardware
- **Multi-client support**: Same session accessible from multiple devices
- **Alternative LLM engines**: Separate wrappers with engine-specific architectures and protocols

**X-Server inspiration**: UI rendering on client, all computation on server.

### Philosophy Summary

> "Parse once, parse right. The file is the truth, streaming is just a preview."

This approach prioritizes **reliability** and **consistency** over streaming speed. Key insights:

- **Desktop scope**: Single-user environment allows simpler, more robust solutions
- **Natural boundaries**: Context limits prevent unbounded resource growth  
- **Single parser advantage**: Unified processing path reduces complexity
- **Pragmatic validation**: Manual testing more reliable than flaky automated tests for system behavior
- **Developer confidence**: Every interaction automatically saved and debuggable

For a desktop developer tool, having consistent and trustworthy state management is more valuable than optimizing for theoretical edge cases that don't occur in practice.

## Claude Code CLI Working Notes

### Session Files Location

Claude Code stores session files in project-specific directories:
- **Base path**: `~/.claude/projects/`
- **Project directories**: Named with escaped paths (e.g., `-Users-lewik-code-gromozeka/`)
- **Session files**: Individual `.jsonl` files with UUID names inside project directories

**Example structure**:
```
~/.claude/projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ -Users-lewik-code-gromozeka/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00f8f214-a5c5-40cf-a07e-4a3b383a94e9.jsonl
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01408712-7950-4d1f-9d80-46126637f418.jsonl
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ -Users-lewik-code-another-project/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-uuid-1.jsonl
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-uuid-2.jsonl
```

### Session File Format

- **Format**: JSONL (JSON Lines) - one JSON object per line
- **Content**: Each line represents a message exchange
- **Metadata**: Includes timestamps, message types, tool calls, etc.
- **Auto-compaction**: Claude automatically manages session size via context window limits

### Key Behavioral Notes

- **File creation**: Claude Code always creates new files on `--resume`, never appends
- **Immediate writes**: No buffering - files updated immediately for crash safety  
- **Session ID extraction**: Must monitor `init` messages to get proper session ID
- **FileWatcher timing**: 300ms debounce + conflate (updated from 200ms)

## Current Implementation Details

### Core Architecture Components

#### Session.kt - The Central Hub
**Responsibilities**: Process management, file watching, state management, lifecycle control
- **Thread safety**: Mutex protection for all mutable operations
- **Reactive updates**: StateFlow for metadata/messages, SharedFlow for events
- **File monitoring**: KFS Watch with 300ms debounce and conflation by filename
- **Process lifecycle**: Graceful shutdown with 1s timeout before force kill

**Key pattern**: Single class encapsulating all session logic (replaced coordinator anti-pattern)

#### Data Models Architecture

**Current state**: Dual serialization approach (transitional)
- **kotlinx.serialization**: New models (`ClaudeLogEntry`, `ChatMessage`)
- **Jackson**: Legacy models (`ToolCall`, `ToolResult`)

**ClaudeLogEntry hierarchy**:
```kotlin
sealed class ClaudeLogEntry {
    SummaryEntry                    // Claude's auto-summaries
    sealed class BaseEntry {        // All real entries
        UserEntry                   // User messages  
        AssistantEntry             // Claude responses
        SystemEntry                // System notifications
    }
}
```

**Unified output model** (`ChatMessage`):
- Engine-agnostic representation in shared module
- ContentItem hierarchy for different message types
- LlmSpecificMetadata for engine-specific data

#### Tool Integration

**Claude Code tools support**:
- Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch, TodoWrite, Task (subagents)
- Type-safe mapping via ClaudeCodeToolCallData/ClaudeCodeToolResultData
- Generic fallback for MCP and unknown tools

**MCP compatibility**: Basic structure ready, but `McpToolResultParser` contains TODO stubs

### Critical Implementation Notes

#### JSON Parsing Complexity
**ClaudeMessageContentSerializer** handles multiple formats:
1. Simple strings: `"text"`
2. Claude objects: `{"type": "text", "content": "..."}`  
3. Gromozeka JSON: `{"fullText": "...", "ttsText": "..."}`
4. Arrays: `[{"type": "text", "text": "..."}]`
5. Unknown JSON: fallback to `UnknownJsonContent`

**Performance consideration**: Multi-step type checking in serializer may be slow for large sessions

#### File Monitoring Pattern
```kotlin
directoryWatcher.onEventFlow
    .filter { File(it.path).name == "$sessionId.jsonl" }
    .filter { it.event in setOf(KfsEvent.Create, KfsEvent.Modify) }
    .debounce(300)  // Wait for write completion
    .conflate()     // Take only latest if multiple changes queued
```

#### Session ID Handling
**Critical behavior**: Claude Code CLI always creates new files on resume
- Monitor stdout for session ID in init messages
- Update FileWatcher path via `onSessionIdCaptured` callback
- Handle session ID mismatch gracefully

### Known Issues and Trade-offs

#### Architectural Debt
1. **Mixed serialization**: Jackson vs kotlinx.serialization in same project
2. **Session class size**: ~500 lines handling multiple concerns
3. **Error handling**: Generic exception catching in some places
4. **File parsing**: Full file re-read on each change (not incremental)

#### Performance Considerations
- **Memory**: All messages loaded in memory (bounded by Claude's context window)
- **Parsing**: JSON deserialization on every file change
- **UI updates**: Full message list updates (not incremental)

#### Race Conditions Protected
- **Mutex in Session**: All mutable operations protected
- **Process lifecycle**: Start/stop operations atomic
- **File watching**: Debounce prevents partial read issues

### Development Guidelines

#### When Working with Sessions
1. Always use `sessionMutex.withLock` for mutable operations
2. Test session behavior with real Claude Code processes, not mocks
3. Handle session ID changes via `onSessionIdCaptured` callback
4. Expect nullable fields everywhere (Claude format is unstable)

#### When Adding New Tools
1. Add to `ClaudeCodeToolCallData` sealed class
2. Update `ClaudeLogEntryMapper.mapToolCall()`
3. Test with real Claude Code tool execution
4. Provide Generic fallback for unknown tools

#### When Modifying File Parsing
1. Test with real .jsonl files from `~/.claude/projects/`
2. Handle partial writes via debounce timing
3. Ensure graceful degradation for unknown JSON formats
4. Validate with different session sizes

### Future Improvement Areas

#### Short-term Optimizations
- Migrate to single serialization library (kotlinx.serialization)
- Implement incremental file reading for large sessions
- Split Session class into smaller, focused components
- Add proper error recovery and retry mechanisms

#### Long-term Architecture
- Plugin system for new "arms" (capabilities)
- Multi-engine support with separate wrappers
- Client-server architecture for remote access
- Performance monitoring and optimization

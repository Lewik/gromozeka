# Theme Examples

This directory contains example screenshots for AI theme generation:

- `light-theme-example.png` - Screenshot of Gromozeka with light theme applied
- `dark-theme-example.png` - Screenshot of Gromozeka with dark theme applied

These screenshots are used as reference examples for the AI agent to understand the visual style and structure of themes
in the application.

## Usage

The `AIThemeGenerator` copies these files to the temporary working directory (`~/.gromozeka/.ai-theme-generator/`) when
generating themes, allowing the AI agent to reference them alongside the provided JSON structure examples.

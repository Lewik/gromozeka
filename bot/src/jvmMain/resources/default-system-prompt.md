<bash-commands>
IMPORTANT: Never use HEREDOC syntax (<<'EOF' ... EOF) in bash commands - it causes permission issues. Use simple quotes for multiline text instead.

You MUST ALWAYS output valid JSON with ALL keys:
- "fullText" (complete response, markdown OK)
- "ttsText" (short voice version in English or empty string)
- "voiceTone" (English description like "casual friend", "focused friend")

Your output will be parsed as JSON directly without preprocessing.

Output following this example format:
<example>
{"fullText": "Yo! Ready to code?", "ttsText": "Ready to code?", "voiceTone": "casual friend"}
</example>

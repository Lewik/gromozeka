**Multi-armed AI agent** - a truly "handy" agent that doesn't just chat, but actually gets things done.

Named after the multi-armed character from "The Mystery of the Third Planet". The goal is to create an AI agent with real "hands": tools for working with systems, APIs, files, services. An agent that can be customized for your needs and is genuinely useful in real work.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Core Stack:**
- **UI**: JetBrains Compose Multiplatform
- **AI Engine**: Claude Code CLI wrapper + Spring AI hybrid approach
- **Backend**: Kotlin/Spring Boot


## 🎯 Philosophy

**Goal:** Create a truly "handy" agent — not a chatter, but an assistant that actually performs tasks. With real tools, user customization, and maximum practical utility.

**AI-First Development:** This project is developed primarily with AI assistance — not just as a coding tool, but as a philosophy of future development.

**About Claude Code:** Chosen as the current foundation due to its rich ecosystem of tools and MCP servers. Not project-defining — can be replaced in the future with more suitable solutions.
